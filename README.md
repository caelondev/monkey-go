A modified implementation of the Monkey programming language interpreter from Thorsten Ball's "Writing an Interpreter in Go". This project serves as a learning exercise where I'm building the interpreter while experimenting with my own modifications and enhancements along the way.

## Overview

Monkey is a fictional programming language created by Thorsten Ball for his book. This interpreter is written in Go and implements core language features including:

- Lexical analysis (tokenization)
- Parsing (AST generation)
- Evaluation
- Error handling

While following the book's foundation, I'm adding my own tweaks and modifications as I deepen my understanding of interpreter design.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/caelondev/monkey-go
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd monkey-go
```

3. Build the binary:

```bash
go build
```

4. Run the interpreter:

```bash
./monkey-go
```
